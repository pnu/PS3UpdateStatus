Simple application that polls PS3 software update version from various CDN addresses.

Disclaimer: I don't have any verified information about the addresses used etc,
so don't blame me if an update happens without noticing it here.

I've deployed this application to address http://ps3updatestatus.dotcloud.com/, which
is a beta service, but feel free to deploy your own.
